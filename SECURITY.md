## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you’ve found an vulnerability, please report it to security@visisto.fi.

We get back to you as soon as possible, usually within five working days.

In your email, please include instructions for reproducing the vulnerability, if possible. Also, please check the [changelog](https://github.com/visiosto/visiosto.github.io/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md) before reporting the vulnerability as it may be already fixed. Don’t disclose the vulnerability publicly before we have got back to you.
