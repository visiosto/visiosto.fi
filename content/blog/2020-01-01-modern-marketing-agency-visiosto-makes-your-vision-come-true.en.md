Good news is the best possible way to start a new decade! Visiosto is a new marketing and communications agency founded last July as the founders of the company were fed up of horrendous visual appearances and faceless work with clients. Too often communication and marketing is built with quick hacks, which is good for nobody. Thus, we founded Visiosto so communication doesn’t have to be fuzzy but your message can be concentrated into an impressive whole that doesn’t only create value for you but also for society.

We founders of Visiosto first met each other in a non-profit organisation. That’s why we know that the accuracy of the lens is everything when it comes to refracting your vision and message into picture. Therefore we want to leave the building of castles in the air for others and construct what you wish – by acting boldly, creating high-class outcomes and interacting personally. That’s why we exist: so your message can touch hearts.

We build what you need to get your message across comprehensively: websites, graphic designs and events. Visually appealing, beautiful and user-friendly websites are our core expertise as potential customers may often want to contact you only if your website pleases the eye. You won’t just be getting well-functioning website but a whole that increases your and your brand’s value. Additionally, your visual appearance defines you and your brand, and the aesthetics of your business is your calling card and your key to recognition. Whether it’s a new logo, print, rebranding or totally new brand, we’ll get the job done. We also share our event production knowledge to help you plan and carry out your vision of both big and small event projects. No matter if it’s a client event, ‘kick-off’ meeting, conference, general assembly or press conference, we take care of it – just as you want it.

If you require competent work and you want to conduct your communication and marketing with high quality, contact us so we can discuss more! You can find our contact details on our website at visiosto.com. You can also find us on social media on Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn by username visiosto and on Twitter by username visiosto_oy.

We’re looking forward to working together during the new decade.

Antti Kivi, CEO
